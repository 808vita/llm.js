# Credits

This project wouldn't be possible without the community efforts on these amazing projects:

- [ggml](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml.git): This is the core & heart for the ggml.js project. Amazing work by Georgi, his team & open source community in maintaining this project.
- [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/): A Very magical static site generator for Markdown docs.

Also some of the interesting finds that I came across while building ggml.js:

- [transformers.js](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js.git): Another great project that is trying to bring hugginface's transformer eco-system into browser. If you liked this project, then you should definitely go check them out.
- [mlc-llm](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm): If you are looking to run LLMs on any device, this project provides the hardware native optimization to efficiently run models.
- [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp.git): C/C++ Port of Large Language Models.
